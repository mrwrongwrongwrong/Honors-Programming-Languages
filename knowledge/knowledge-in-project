Declaration:
In computer programming, a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) "means".[1] 
Declarations are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions

In programming, a declaration is a statement describing an identifier, such as the name of a variable or a function. ... 
For example, in the C programming language, all variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be assigned a value.2
