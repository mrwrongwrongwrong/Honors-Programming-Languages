1. Algoritm W



Question 1:
Prove 
There will be a recursive function and we will prove it for reasoning 

Question 2 & Question 3
2nd and 3rd question on Fixed point
and its corresponding Variant 

Prove something is increasing

Meanwhile, please review the most classic and famous theory in fixed point.
Variant of classic fixed point theorem (maybe rice theorem)

Question 4
Types
three subquestions
1. An easy beginning questions, composite type or type inference, similar to MiniOO
2. Type each term and internal relation
3. Type system, rule for type system program
